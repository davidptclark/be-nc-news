## Running the API Locally

Before beginning setup, please check you have _at least_ these versions of the following:

- `Node.js` - v. 17.5.0
- `Postgres` - v. 14.1

After doing so, perform each step, in order:

### Cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/davidptclark/be-nc-news.git
```

### Install required packages:

Simply run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies required.

### Environment setup:

This repository does not contain the necessary .env files that set the value of PGDATABASE to a specific database, as they are part of the gitignore and will only be stored locally. After cloning, you will need to create two .env files in the root directory:

_.env.development_

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

_.env.test_

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

### Seeding local databases:

To start the API, run the command `npm start`. This will instruct the API to listen on the default port: 9090.

If you would like to reinitialise the database, use the command `npm run setup-db` followed by `npm run seed` to re-seed the database.

### Running tests:

The available endpoint have been created using Jest and pre-written tests are found in `./__tests__/`. The test files are configured to re-seed the database after each test is complete; to run these tests, as well as any you have written, use the command `npm test FILENAME`.
